You begin in your room. It is an ordinary day like any other. After
looking around the room a bit (hopefully discovering the door, a
cabinet with torch/knife, light switch). You receive a call saying
that your daughter Eva is with her friends and won't be home until
late. You see on the computer/hear on hear on the radio a report that
an AI researcher has made a major breakthrough, but dismiss it. You go
to sleep.

November 2nd 2018 3:00 A.M.

You wake up with a start. Things seem - quiet. You wonder if Eva made
it home yet. You get up out of bed and try to turn on the light -
doesn't work! Everything is dark, you stumble around and pick up a
torch. (this allows you to see somewhat more than without). You walk
out of the room calling for Eva. No answer. Keep exploring until you
walk out the front door.


Your house:

  | Your     | Eva's   | Bath  |  Lounge   |
  | Room     | Room    | room  |   Room    |

Suddenly, a car screeches to a stop outside your house (floodlights
etc.) It's your neighbour/friend Jim. He gets out of the car.
You: "Jim what's happening, the powers out -- where's Eva!".
Jim: There's no time to explain! Take this, they're going to kill me!
(gives you papers)
You: "Who ... Jim wait!"
Jim: "Guard those papers with your life! They're the only way to stop this madness!"
Jim: "No time, if any of the Eye Corporation goons come, tell them nothing"
You: "I know nothing! How could I possibly tell them anything!?"
Jim: "Thanks, I appreciate it, I'm out of here"


Jim walks back to the car, but before he can get in, some goons walk up.

Goon 1: "That's him!"
Goon 2: "Well don't just stand there, kill him!"
Goon 1 kills Jim
Goon 2: "Now get the papers!"
...
Goon 1: "Where are they!"
Goon 2: "I don't know, this guy must have them!" (points torch at you)
Goon 1: "Well kill him as well!"

(you run back into house to find a weapon as they walk in)

You kill the goons.
